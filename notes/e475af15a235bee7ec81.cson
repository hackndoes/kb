  # OpenSSL
  
  ## Generate Self-Signed certificate
  
  1. Generates a 2048-bit (recommended) RSA private key
  ```sh
  openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
  ```
  
  2. Generates a Certificate Signing Request, which you could instead use to generate a CA-signed certificate. This step will ask you questions; be as accurate as you like since you probably arenâ€™t getting this signed by a CA
  ```sh
  openssl req -new -sha256 -key key.pem -out csr.csr
  ```
  
  3. Generates a self-signed x509 certificate suitable for use on web servers. This is the file you were after all along, congrats!
  ```sh
  openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -key key.pem -in csr.csr -out certificate.pem
  ```
  
  4. The check at the end ensures you will be able to use your certificate beyond 2016. OpenSSL on OS X is currently insufficient, and will silently generate a SHA-1 certificate that will be rejected by browsers in 2017. Update using your package manager, or with Homebrew on a Mac and start the process over.
  ```sh
  openssl req -in csr.csr -text -noout | grep -i "Signature.*SHA256" && echo "All is well" || echo "This certificate will stop working in 2017! You must update OpenSSL to generate a widely-compatible certificate"
  ```
